Nathan Rasch has worked throughout his career as a leader, project manager, and software developer.  He has an MBA in business administration, a BA in Mathematics, is a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM), and a PMI Certified Associate in Project Management (CAPM). He's worked in a number of challenging fields such as biopharmaceuticals, banking, and telecommunications.

Some of Nathan's successful work experiences include:

* Leadership of Investability’s primary cross-functional software development team.  He effectively led the team from historically missing sprint commitments to a release record of on-time sprint commitment delivery by working to increase team morale and cohesion, removing roadblocks and building relationships with other departments, and putting in place an effective software development and deployment process.

* Single-handed development of a prototype software as a service (SaaS) application in one month which led to the sale of that system for seven-plus clinical drug studies and netted over $2M in sales in the first year.  He then went on to successfully expand the department’s headcount from one to sixteen (including remote and offshore resources) to sustain business growth, add to the product’s feature set, and successfully meet critical client business needs.


* At Point of Reference he grew the engineering department’s headcount from two to seven while creating the department’s organizational structure, processes, procedures, best practices, etc.  Nathan also oversaw major upgrades and new feature additions to the organization’s core product offering to attract and retain multiple Fortune 500 customers such as VMware, Lexmark, Amazon Web Services, and Blue Coat Systems.
