Nathan Rasch has worked throughout his career as a leader, project manager, and software developer.  He has an MBA in business administration, a BA in Mathematics, a Project Management Professional (PMP) PMI certification, and he is a Certified ScrumMaster (CSM). He's worked in a number of challenging fields such as start ups, biopharmaceuticals, banking, and telecommunications.

Some of Nathan's successful work experiences include:

* Successful operations at the strategic level including defining multi-year roadmaps and budgets, creating and implementing the technology department’s overarching SLDC vision, and developing the company’s release management methodologies and procedures.

* Single-handed development of a prototype software as a service (SaaS) application in one month which led to the sale of that system for seven-plus clinical drug studies and netted over $2M in sales in the first year.  He then went on to successfully expand headcount from one to sixteen (including remote and offshore resources) to sustain business growth, add to the product’s feature set, and successfully meet critical client business needs.

* More than doubled the engineering department’s headcount while creating the department’s organizational structure, processes, procedures, best practices, etc.  He also oversaw major upgrades and new feature additions to the organization’s core product offering to attract and retain multiple Fortune 500 customers such as VMware, Lexmark, Amazon Web Services, and Blue Coat Systems.

* Added value to the organization's quality management processes by spearheading the initiative to introduce and develop automated testing utilizing Java and Selenium to mitigate testing bottlenecks in the software deployment process, reduce the workload on the QC staff, and improve the quality of deployments.
